                    Designing responsive websites using both pure HTML and CSS or with HTML and the Bootsrap framework each have their unique pros and cons.
                    When designing a webpage using HTML with CSS, there are more styling options in comparison to using the Bootstrap framework. The intuative 
                    box design of CSS makes it easier to formulate a page layout, resulting in a cleaner website. However, this tends to fall apart when the screen
                    size changes. The media quaries of CSS do help remedy this issue, but it is time consuming to resize all the styled elements to fit a new screen.
                    It does result in a responsive page however as the screen size is reacheaching the pre-defined max-width or min-width of the media quaries, 
                    the layout of the page begins to fall apart and then once a defined width is reached, the elements look tidy. Resulting in a abrupt transition
                    between layouts.

                    The strength of the Bootsrap framework lies in where CSS fails. The automatic column resizing feauture of the
                    bootsrap framework makes transitioning between screen sizes smooth and responsive. Naturally, because of it's automatic nature, this makes the process 
                    of creating the website quicker than CSS. As the screen size shrinks, the columns begin to stack on top of one another which can look aesthetically
                    pleasing to the eye on smaller devices. However, the Bootstrap framework does have its weaknesses. Using just the Bootsrap framework alone with no CSS 
                    styling results in a messy layout. Spacing will be targetted towards one side of the margin, font options and sizing are limited as well. There are no options
                    for colours, unordered lists, and naturally, the box model of CSS is not availible. I Personally faced this issue, and to remedy that, I was forced to use
                    a short CSS stylesheet. Overall, I enjoyed using both options however I strongly believe in using both in combination. To further elaborate, 
                    Using CSS to layout the page and the Bootstrap framework for it's automatic resizing would result in a aesthetically pleasing, user-friendly page 
                    that takes less time to make.
